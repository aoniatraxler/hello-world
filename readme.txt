Hello!
This is part of the Git-it tutorial.

Some commands investigated include git add git commit git diff and now we will push the changes from our local repo to the remote repo so other collaborators can work on it with git push <origin> <master>. The remote repo will have the same info as local repo, on the master branchof our primary remote <origin>
